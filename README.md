#PoemSquare

PoemSquare is an activity developed as part of research experiment on the poem vowels written by Arthur Rimbaud(1854-1891).

Idea of the prooject: 

The main idea of the project is provide a interactive interface for the students to translate the poem to a PoemSquare. A PoemSquare is a multi-media experience where the mediator compose from media files. The PoemSquare synthesizes representations of the poem’s sounds, images, words, and movement in a different art form. 


#Description of the Activity:

1.  Reflect on your observations from the experiments and begin to draw some conclusions about what and how the poem means for you.   

2.  Translate the poem into a PoemSquare.  A PoemSquare is a brief multi-media experience of the poem.  The PoemSquare integrates   representations of the poem’s sounds, images, words, and movement in a different art form.  To create your PoemSquare, you may upload sound, image, video, or text files you found during the experiments or you can create and upload your own files as long as the extensions are compatible with PoemSquare.  

	•	The PoemSquare has nine tiles that are numbered 1-9.  You may choose to eliminate tiles or to reconfigure the layout of the tiles to suit your perception of the movement of the poem.  You may arrange the tiles sequentially or non-sequentially.
	
	•	For each tile you use, you may upload 
		(1) a still image. 
		(2) a 10-second video.
		(3) a 10-second audio.
		(4) Text.

3. Once you create a PoemSquare, You may choose the play mode for each PoemSquare you create.  

You might want to create a PoemSquare in several different play modes using the same interpretive perspective and media files.  Or you might want to approach each PoemSquare from a different interpretive perspective using a whole new set of images and sounds.  

MANUAL: Players click on any tile to play it individually.  They may play the tiles in any order and as many times as they like.
