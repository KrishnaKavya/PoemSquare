#PoemSquare

PoemSquare is an activity developed as part of research experiment on the poem vowels written by Arthur Rimbaud(1854-1891).

Idea of the prooject: The main idea of the project is provide a interactive interface for the students to translate the poem to a PoemSquare. A PoemSquare is a multi-media experience where the user compose from media files. The PoemSquare synthesizes representations of the poem’s sounds, images, words, and movement in a different art form. 


#Description of the Activity:

Home Page: The first screen of the activity a user sees will be the home page having the philosophical instruction for the user. These instructions gives ideas and motivation to the user. 

Folder Structure Page: The Second screen of the activity requests the user to give a name to the PoemSquare that he will be devloping. 

Activity Page: The Third screen is the last screen where the user creates the PoemSquare.

	A	B	C
Black A, white E, red I, green U, blue O - vowels,		
Some day I will open your silent pregnancies:
A, black belt, hairy with burst flies,
Bumbling and buzzing over stinking cruelties,

Pits of night; E, candour of sand pavilions,
High glacial spears, white kings, trembling Queen Anne's lace;
I, bloody spittle, laughter dribbling from a face
In wild denial or in anger, vermilions;				      
      L				    M				     N
U,…divine movement of viridian seas,
Peace of pastures animal-strewn, peace of calm lines
Drawn on foreheads worn with heavy alchemies;

O, supreme Trumpet, harsh with strange stridencies,
Silences traced in angels and astral designs:
O…Omega…the violet light of His Eyes!

PoemSquare Instructions

Play modes
You may choose the play mode for each PoemSquare you create.  You might want to create a PoemSquare in several different play modes using the same interpretive perspective and media files.  Or you might want to approach each PoemSquare from a different interpretive perspective using a whole new set of images and sounds.  

MANUAL: Players click on any tile to play it individually.  They may play the tiles in any order and as many times as they like.
SLIDESHOW: Players click on the first tile to play the PoemSquare as a slideshow according to any sequence the mediator has determined.
DATABASE: Players click on the first tile to play a slideshow generated by random computer selections.
SIMULCAST:  Players click anywhere on the PoemSquare to play all tiles simultaneously.


Database
The Remaking Poetry database is a collaborative effort.  You and other mediators will create it by adding still image, moving image, and sound files to the database as you are working the experiments and creating your translations.  Media files may be copied from outside sources to the database following the “Fair Use Guidelines” (See “Resources”).  You also may create your own media files using (1) programs you access on your personal electronic devices, or (2) programs installed by the district on school electronic devices, or (3) open source software programs downloaded to your home or classroom computers.  All files added to the database must be G/PG-rated and must comply with the district’s Acceptable Use Policy.

All moving image and sound files should be 10 seconds or less in duration.

Compatible media files are: jpeg, png, and gif for still image; mov and mp4 for moving image; mp3 and wav for sound.

Open source software:  Audacity (sound editor), Blender (video editor/animation generator), GIMP 2 (photo editor)


Upload media files
To upload media files to a tile, click on the appropriate icon to browse the database, select the file, and open it.  In a single tile, you may upload a variety of configurations: a sound file only, a still image only, a combination of a sound file and still image, a moving image with sound, or a muted moving image plus a sound file.  

Text
You will be able to add/edit text in any tile.  However, use of text should be minimal.

Settings
You will be able to adjust features related to timing and volume.  If you are creating in the Slideshow mode, you will at this time determine the sequence in which the tile will play.  The letters remain fixed, but you can create desired effects by determining the play sequence, combined with leaving some spaces blank (see “Delete” below).

Preview

After completing the uploads and adding text – if desired – preview the tile and make any modifications.  Be sure to save your work as you complete each tile so that you will be able to return to the PoemSquare if you are unable to complete it in one sitting.
 
 
Delete/Restore
Delete any tiles you will not use.  Click in the reload button to restore the tile if needed.  

Save to the PoemSquare Showcase
When you have finished your PoemSquare, click “FINISH.”  “FINISH” saves your creation to the PoemSquare Showcase where you and others may view it at any time.  Once your PoemSquare is in the showcase, you can no longer edit it.
